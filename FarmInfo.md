In 1780, the Osgoods claimed the land where the farm is now operating and chopped it out of the woodlands that were described in town history as "infested with bears". We still see bears on occasion, and are proud to continue the farming tradition. We are currently raising beef and lamb, growing vegetables, berries and apples, cutting hay and firewood and have a retail store right on the John Stark Highway. "Nana", at age 89, is still baking up a storm (with help) with homemade pies and other goodies almost every day! We invite you to stop by for the freshest and best local products available in the region!

Located on the John Stark Highway (1047 John Stark Highway) between Newport and Claremont New Hampshire, our retail store looks like a little red barn. We have a couple of goats and/or sheep at the store...our mini-petting zoo. We are five miles outside each town. The farm itself is about a quarter mile up McDonough Road (turn at the Rental Center), with our pick-your-own blueberries and raspberries at the farm location.

Beaver Pond Farm is a family owned and operated diversified farm. We currently raise maple, vegetables, beef, lamb, berries, apples, hay, firewood, and a wide variety of summer and fall crops. What we don't raise, we try to buy locally and have a wonderful selection of the freshest and the best that Sullivan County, New Hampshire and neighbors in Vermont have to offer!

RASPBERRIES & BLUEBERRIES
The pick-your-own raspberry patch is an acre and a half of the most luscious and easy-to-pick raspberries you will find. We take customer service very seriously, and try to make your visit a delightful experience that you will look forward to repeating! We provide free picking containers (pint baskets) and ask that you pick into our containers as we charge by the pint, not the pound. Children of all ages are welcome, but we ask that you leave your pets at home. We have a porta-potty for your convenience, and provide fresh water to quench your thirst, but if you want a snack, other drinks or to have a picnic, you will need to bring your own! We welcome you to make a mad dash for a pint or two or make a family day of your outing. It's a relatively short season, so we want you to enjoy it as much as we do!
Opening somewhere around July 5...call for daily conditions: (603) 543-1107
OPEN 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. daily through July
(weather and picking condition dependent)

Beaver Pond Farm is located in the quaint, quiet New Hampshire town of Newport. With a population of just over 6,000, Newport offers visitors a beautiful setting for their vacations or to set up their lives. We are just minutes away from Mount Sunapee which offers wonderful skiing and recreation opportunities, Lake Sunapee which is one of the largest and most beautiful lakes in the state, and the Connecticut River, which is one of the most beautiful waterways in New England. We are blessed to have been born into a farming family that preserved the agricultural heritage of the area, and we feel honored to continue the farming tradition into the future.
Our retail outlet is right on Route 11 & 103 (John Stark Highway), a busy route between Newport and Claremont. We are easy to find, and are only minutes away from Newport, Claremont, Lebanon, Sunapee, New London and all the beautiful little villages in between. GPS us at 1046 John Stark Highway, Newport or 50 McDonough Road, Newport.

The farm was chopped out the forest in 1780 when the William Osgood family moved first to Claremont, NH from Massachusetts where they first emigrated from England. William Osgood purchased land in Newport shortly after the original settlers came to the area. The family expanded on the original 100 acres and now owns 265 acres that is mostly in forested or maple-orchard land, with about 20 acres in tillable land where vegetables, apples and berries are produced. We are very proud of our heritage as farmers on the very place our ancestors chose, and to be the seventh, eighth and ninth generations of family to now work the soil here.

Becky (McDonough) Nelson is the eighth generation of the same family to own and work the land at Beaver Pond Farm. Her father, Fred, recently passed away, but her mother, Norma, is taunting the 90 age mark and is still making pies for the farm store! Becky's husband, Ben, runs the production end of the business. They met at the University of New Hampshire, and joined Becky's parents in partnership shortly after the marriage. Their daughter, Kathryn, works in education in southern NH while seeking her Master's degree, and their son, Samuel, has returned to work part-time at the farm (bringing fresh ideas and lots of energy!) while holding a full-time position at Sugar River Valley Regional Technical Center in Newport (Newport Middle&High School) as Forestry/Natural Resources Instructor. Both Kathryn and Samuel received their degrees at the University of New Hampshire. A long history keeps the family "rooted and growing" here in Sullivan County.
